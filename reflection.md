- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?

It is confusing to figure out why they have certain associations and how it changed the codes. 


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I was not clear about what I was supposed to get in the end. I was fine until Train and I lost track. 

ADDITION:
Making a car within the train and calling the same printManifest() was very confusing. With the help of TAs, I was able to figure out how to connect and call the function.
